Gaussian Inversion:

The program first checks if the number of rows and columns in the matrix are equal because they must be equal to be inverted. If they are not equal the program throws an exception and prints "Wrong matrix size, rows != columns. If they are equal the program creates a result matrix which is the same size as the original matrix. The program then creates a vector b which will be used when making a linear system. The program then tries to make a linear system out of the matrix and vector b and then solve then. The solution is now saved in a newly created vector x and the ith column of the result matrix is set. The program then loops until all of the columns have been filled with their corresponding solution vectors. The result matrix is then returned and the program terminates.

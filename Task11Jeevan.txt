One aspect I learnt about java is how much other classes can rely on each other. You could write one piece of code that gets used in multiple other classes. I also learned about java is how easy it is to read. There are much less minor syntax issues in java than C. In C, if you forgot a , you could get a bunch of errors but in java it just points to what line you are missing something and only one error shows up.
